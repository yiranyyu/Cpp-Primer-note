# Object-Oriented Programming

1. Each class controls how its members are initialized
2. The base class is initialized first, and then the members of the derived class are initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class.
3. If a base class defines a static member, there is only one such member defined for the entire hierarchy.
4. we can prevent a class from being used as a base by following the class name with final.
5. We must define every virtual function, regardless of whether it is used, because the compiler has no way to determine whether a virtual function is used
6. A derived-class function that overrides an inherited virtual function must have exactly the same parameter type(s) as the base-class function that it overrides.
7. With one exception, the return type of a virtual in the derived class also must match the return type of the function from the base class. The exception applies to virtuals that return a reference (or pointer) to types that are themselves related by inheritance. Example

```C++
class Base
{
public:
    virtual Base* rtnPtr() { return 0; }
protected:
    int prot_mem;
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    virtual Derived* rtnPtr() override{ return 0; } // ok , Derived is derived-class of Base.
};
```

8. A function that is virtual in a base class is implicitly virtual in its derived classes. When a derived class overrides a virtual, the parameters in the base and derived classes must match exactly
9. We can designate a function as final. Any attempt to override a function that has been defined as final will be flagged as an error.
10. final and override specifiers appear after the parameter list (including any const or reference qualifiers) and after a trailing return.
11. If a class uses a default argument, the value that is used is the one defined by the static type through which the function is called.
12. Virtual functions that have default arguments should use the same argument values in the base and derived classes.
13. In some cases, we want to prevent dynamic binding of a call to a virtual function; We can use the scope operator to force that call to use a particular version of that virtual.
14. The =0 may appear only on the declaration of a virtual function in the class body.
15. We can provide a definition for a purevirtual. However, the function body must be defined outside the class.
16. A derived class member or friend may access the protected members of the base class only through a derived object. The derived class has no special access to the protected members of base-class objects. Example

```C++
class Base
{
    friend class Pal;
public:
    virtual Base* rtnPtr() { return 0; }
protected:
    int prot_mem;
};

// Derived class has no special access to the protected members of base-class objects.
class Sneaky : public Base
{
    friend void clobber(Sneaky&);
    friend void clobber(Base&);

    int j; // private by default;
};

// ok: clobber can access the private and protected members of Sneaky objects.
void clobber(Sneaky &s) { s.j = s.prot_mem = 0;}

// error: clobber can't access the protected members in Base;
void clobber(Base &b) {/*    b.prot_mem = 0; */}

class Pal
{
    int f(Base b){return b.prot_mem;} // ok: pal is a friend of Base

    int f2(Sneaky s) { return s.j; } // error: Pal is not friend of Sneaky

    int f3(Sneaky s) { return s.prot_mem ;}// ok: Pal is a friend of Base
};
```

17. Accessibility of Derived-to-Base Conversion
+ User code may use the derived-to-base conversion only if D inherits publicly from B. User code may not use the conversion if D inherits from B using either protected or private.
+ Member functions and friends of D can use the conversion to B regardless of how D inherits from B. The derived-to-base conversion to a direct base class is always accessible to members and friends of a derived class.
+ Member functions and friends of classes derived from D may use the derived-to-base conversion if D inherits from B either public or protected. Such code may not use the conversion if B inherits privately from B.
18. Each class controls access to its own members. The access includes access to Base objects that are embedded in an object of type derived from Base. Example
19. We can change the access level of a name that derived class inherits by providing a using declaration. Access to a name specified in a using declaration depends on the access specifier preceding the using declaration. Example

```C++
class PriDerived : private Base
{
public:
    using Base::rtnPtr; // maintain access level for public member of base class
protected:
    using Base::prot_mem;
};
```

20. A derived class may provide a using declaration only for names it is permitted to access.
21. By default, a derived class defined with the class keyword has private inheritance; a derived class defined with struct has public inheritance;
22. The only differences of classes defined using the struct keyword and those defined using class are the default access specifier for members and the default derivation access specifier. There are no other distinctions.
23. A derived-class member with the same name as a member of the base class hides direct use of the base-class member.
24. Aside from overriding inherited virtual functions, a derived class usually should not reuse names defined in its base class.
25. If a ctor or dtor calls a virtual, the version that is run is the one corresponding to the type of the ctor or dtor itself.
26. Unlike using declarations for ordinary members, a ctor using declaration does not change the access level of the inherited ctor(s).
27. Moreover, a using declaration canâ€™t specify explicit or constexpr.
28. If a base-class ctor has default arguments, those arguments are not inherited. Instead, the derived class gets multiple inherited ctors in which each parameter with a default argument is successively omitted. For example, if the base has a ctor with two parameters, the second of which has a default, the derived class will obtain two ctors: one with both parameters (and on default argument) and a second ctor with a single parameter corresponding to the left-most, non-defaulted parameter in the base class. Example

```C++
class Constructor
{
public:
    Constructor(int i, int j = 3) :v1(i), v2(j){}
    int v1, v2;
};

class InheritConstructor : public Constructor
{
    using Constructor::Constructor;

    /*
    get two ctors like:

    InheritConstructor(int i) :Construtor(i){}

    InheritConstructor(int i, int j) : Constructor(i, j){}

    not inherit the default value
    */

};
```

29. If a base class has several ctors, then with two exceptions, the derived class inherits each of the ctors from its base class.
+ The first exception is that a derived class can inherit some ctors and define its own versions of the other ctors. If the derived class defines a ctor with the same parameters as a ctor in the base, then that ctor is not inherited. The one defined in the derived class is used in place of the inherited ctor.
+ The second exception is that the default, copy, and move ctor are not inherited. These ctors are synthesized using the normal roles. An inherited ctor is not treated as a user-defined ctor. Therefor, a class that contains only inherited ctors will have a synthesized default ctor.
